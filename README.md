# Nearest_Neighbor_Declustering
 Implementation of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2020) Declustering Algorithm.

 These codes implement the nearest-neighbor declustering algorithm described by Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2020). They were written by Dr. Ilya Zaliapin before his tragic passing and are published as is, with permission by Dr. Ben-Zion. If you use these codes in your research, please cite the following manuscript:
